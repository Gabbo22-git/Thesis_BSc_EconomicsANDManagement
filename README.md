The Core Idea: The Real Revolution is Financial Data Access (FiDA)
This project is not just about the Python code, it’s about the bigger picture. 
The true innovation lies in the European Union’s ongoing effort to make financial data more accessible through the Financial Data Access (FiDA) Regulation. 
Historically, banks have monopolized financial data, using it as a competitive advantage. 
FiDA aims to break this monopoly by enabling secure and regulated access to financial data, fostering innovation, competition, and improved financial services.

Current Challenges & Data Generation
At present, these financial datasets are not yet available, which presents a challenge for developing AI-driven solutions. 
To bridge this gap, I have synthetically generated financial data using the script dati.py. 
The generated data is not random, but carefully designed to mimic real-world financial data distributions, both for user profiles and financial products.

Machine Learning Model
The project employs XGBoost (Gradient Boosting Classifier) to build a recommendation system trained on the generated financial data. 
The model was optimized across multiple iterations, with version v6acc80 achieving the best performance. It has been saved using joblib for reproducibility.

Why This Matters
This project serves as a proof of concept demonstrating how open financial data could revolutionize the industry. 
By leveraging AI and machine learning, personalized financial services could be developed, providing users with better investment opportunities, smarter financial decisions, and more competitive financial products.
Imagine a near future in Italy, a country known for its population of high savers. 
With the implementation of FiDA, banks could develop AI-driven recommendation apps that leverage highly reliable and regulated financial data. 
These apps would accurately suggest tailored financial products to users, optimizing deposits and unlocking stagnant capital.
For example, an Italian bank’s app could analyze a user’s financial profile and recommend personalized investment options, persuading them to invest rather than keeping large amounts of money idle in low-interest savings accounts. 
With enhanced data reliability and AI precision, banks could significantly improve capital allocation, benefiting both individual users (by maximizing their returns) and the broader financial ecosystem.
As financial data becomes more widely accessible, the potential for data-driven financial innovation will only grow. 
This project anticipates that future, showcasing what’s possible when AI meets open finance.
